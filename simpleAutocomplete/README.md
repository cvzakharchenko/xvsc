# [Unabbreviate](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cvzakharchenko.unabbreviate)

Fewer keystrokes, no-nonsense autocomplete that cycles through matches based on fuzzy word search performed on the open document(s). This is like IntelliJ's Cyclic Expand Word or NetBeans Hippie Completion.

## Extension Settings

This extension adds one command:

* `unabbreviate.next`: which cycles through the autocomplete results

**Note** No keybinding is provided by this extension. You have to create one yourself.
